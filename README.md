# Ornate syntax

The name of this syntax might seem like an overstatement relative to some of the syntax themes available, but for me this is about as elaborate as it gets with five (five!) accent colors. Many of the style choices here are deliberately decorative, but I'm still sticking to pretty basic highlighting rules as with other themes I've done. I've made an effort to make this one pretty, I admit it.

### Languages supported

- CoffeeScript
- CSS
- GitHub flavored markdown
- html
- Java
- JavaScript
- JSON
- JSX
- Ruby

Styling for css includes less, but Sass could be hit or miss. The jsx style rules are based on orktes' [react](https://atom.io/packages/react) package.
