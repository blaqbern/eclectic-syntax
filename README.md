# Eclectic syntax

This is a bit more elaborate than other syntax themes I've with five (five!) accent colors. Many of the style choices here are deliberately decorative, but I'm still sticking to pretty basic highlighting rules as with other themes I've done. I've made an effort to make this one pretty, I admit it.

### Languages supported

- [Babel](atom.io/packages/language-babel)
- CoffeeScript
- CSS
- GitHub flavored markdown
- html
- Java
- JavaScript
- JSON
- Ruby

Styling for css includes less, but Sass could be hit or miss.
