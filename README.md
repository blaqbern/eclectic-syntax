# Eclectic syntax

I generally stick to very stripped-down highlighting rules, but I've allowed myself to be more elaborate--and even deliberately decorative in some cases--with this one. Also added support for the excellent [language-babel](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel) package.

### Languages supported

- Babel
- CoffeeScript
- CSS
- GitHub flavored markdown
- html
- Java
- JavaScript
- JSON
- Ruby

Styling for css includes less, but Sass could be hit or miss.
